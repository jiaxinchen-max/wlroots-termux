 * The formula is approximated via a 3D look-up table. A 3D LUT is a
 * three-dimensional array where each element is an RGB triplet. The flat lut_3d
 * array has a length of dim_lenÂ³.
 *
 * Color channel values in the range [0.0, 1.0] are mapped linearly to
 * 3D LUT indices such that 0.0 maps exactly to the first element and 1.0 maps
 * exactly to the last element in each dimension.
 *
 * The offset of the RGB triplet given red, green and blue indices r_index,
 * g_index and b_index is:
 *
 *     offset = 3 * (r_index + dim_len * g_index + dim_len * dim_len * b_index)

/**
 * This is a color transform that is specified by three seperate ramps that
 * modify the RGB values individually. This means that this color transform type
 * cannot be used to create a transform that can infruence color channels
 * depending on the values of other color channels.
 *
 * This color transform is modeled off of the wlr-gamma-control-unstable-v1
 * wayland protocol.
 *
 * The memory layout of this type requires that the r, g, b color channel ramps
 * are inline in memory. A ramp value can be retrieved from memory:
 *
 *     offset = dim_len * rgb_channel_index + ramp_index
 *
 * This is an offset into the `r` pointer and can be used to retrieve the ramps
 * from the other channels as the ramps are linear in memory. The three pointers
 * are given for convenience.
 *
 * Note that when freeing the color transform, only the `r` channel is freed as
 * a it's expected that a single malloc will allocate all three channels at once.
